Most of our regular walks are an hour long and these require a reasonable level of ﬁtness, however we also have a shorter, slower paced walk for those who want or need to go at a more gentle pace. Our hour long walks are a mix of ﬂat and hilly walks to suit different ﬁtness needs. We also run a Nordic walking circuits class if you are looking for that little bit extra to tone and trim your body.</p>

                                        <p class="lead"> The very best footwear is waterproof, breathable walking shoes. If you don't have these then trainers are good (but you'll get wet feet if the grass is wet). Walking boots are good because they support your ankles but the sole is often quite rigid, making it difﬁcult to roll your foot actively, which is part of the Nordic walking technique. Take a look at our blog on what shoes to wear forNordic walking for more information and some recommendations.<br><br>(Top tip - if you only have trainers why not buy some waterproof socks to keep your feet dry in wet conditions?)</p>

                                        <p class="lead"> No special clothing is required. Check out the weather conditions and be sensible. Layered clothing is best, with breathable fabrics and a waterproof jacket. Nothing bulky though as this will restrict you when you walk. A hat and gloves are important in cold weather. Jogging bottoms or stretchy trousers are better than jeans. We have various blogs on what you should wear when Nordic walking- click here to read them.</p>

Most of our classes are designed to improve general ﬁtness and we look at the min a similar way to a gym class, but you can make your walk as hard or as easy as you want. Come to a Beginner Workshop and our instructors can evaluate your fitness and discuss which Nordic walks will be best for you.We link up with Penny Brohn Cancer Care and run Nordic walking classes from their centre in Pill.We also run two regular weekly walks for people with Parkinsons on Clifton Downs - see our Rehab Page or contact us for more details.</p>
