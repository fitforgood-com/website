                                <p>As a teenager I was overweight, but I got tired of feeling lethargic all the time, so I joined a gym at 15 and the rest is history. I was amazed at how good exercising made me feel. It gave me the drive to work hard at school and greatly improved my mood. I started to enjoy life a bit more and my confidence improved. Ten years later I decided that personal training was my passion - after I took my mum through the same journey that I went on. She lost three stone and now runs for a running club three times a week. </p>

                                <p>My main inspiration is seeing what my body is capable of. There is no limit on what the human body can do and I am always finding new and challenging ways to move and improve my fitness. Seeing others realise their potential also motivates me - if I had a penny for every time a client has told me “I cannot do that” and then goes on to exceed their expectations then I’d be rich! </p>

                                <p>In my spare time I like to completely relax - whether that’s just chilling on the sofa or a weekend away. I spend my life on my feet and teaching fitness, so time away is crucial. It allows me to be the best I can be when I go into work every day. </p>

                                <p>Remember to breathe whilst exercising. It sounds silly but a lot of people hold their breath when partaking in physical activity - due to nervousness or the adrenaline of moving in a challenging way. Long and deep inhales and exhales, breathing through the nose and out of the mouth, will help you relax and lower your heart rate, which in turn will allow you to continue for longer without having to stop to take a break. </p>

                                <p>I came into fitness later in life at age 30 in 1999 after being diagnosed with Diabetes, high Cholesterol, high blood pressure and being told I had a 80% risk of a heart attack all following a life time of bad eating habits. I made a commitment to myself there and then that I would loose 6 stone (38kg) of body fat and exercise myself back to fitness (which I did!) and then help others to do the same too.&nbsp; </p>

                                <p> I’m inspired everyday by someone or something, today it happens to be a middle aged man who comes regularly to my class and never misses a week. Why is this so inspirational? He has learning and communication difficulties, however throughout the class he moves and flows perfectly along with everyone else and to an onlooker he would just appear as everyone else does. He has gained so much from the classes, fat loss, muscle strength, community, and most importantly acceptance from the group. </p>

                                <p>Honestly I don’t have much free time as I spend so much time working in the fitness industry and further studying for fitness related exams to broaden my knowledge. When I do get time I enjoy walking the dog with my husband who also works in fitness. I also enjoy a variety of music and for fun watching ‘conspiracy theory’ videos on YouTube.&nbsp; </p>

                                <p>My family has always been fairly active. My grandfather loved hiking and skiing which he passed on to all of us. He took up running in his 60s and kept at it into his 90s. My grandmother was a great swimmer, in both the ocean and in pools. Every winter she’d set off for a couple of weeks to try a new swimming beach in some exotic location. My parents loved playing tennis and sailing. My sister is amazing – still climbing mountains and skiing in her 60s.<br> </p>

                                <p>Not a lot of free time but when we can, we are often gardening and dog walking - and we love garden visiting through the National Gardens Scheme.<br> </p>
